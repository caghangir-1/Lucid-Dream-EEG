EDFDecomposer(multipleFolders=folders, writing_directory=directory)

Functions:
1- The function ables to decompose infinite amount of EDF files as input by giving directory list
2- It decomposes specifications of EDF files folder by folder, create .csv file and put information into that file.
   * It extracts meta_edf_decomposition.csv file into directory you want.
   * It writes file ID, channel_size, channel names, sampling rates, length of EEG data as minutes and hours column by column
     for each EDF file grouped by each folder contains EDF files in it (most probably files from same lab).
3- It extracts meta_edf_decomposition_overall.txt file into directory you want.
   * Inside of a .txt file these information are extracted folder by folder:
       - Amount of EDF files
       - Time period of smallest EDF file
       - Time period of biggest EDF file
       - Sampling rate (Fs) variations
       - Most used Fs
       - Unique channels
       - Common channels
       - Amount of common channels
   * Overall information regarding to all .edf files of all folders are extracted in the final:
       - Total amount of whole EDF files
       - Time period of smallest EDF file
       - Time period of biggest EDF file
       - Sampling rate (Fs) variations
       - Most used Fs
       - Total unique channels
       - Total common channels
       - Total amount of common channels
